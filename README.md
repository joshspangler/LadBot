# LadBot
Using several online and free guides, LadBot is my first attempt at a Discord bot. It is fully written in Node.js (v. 11.something). While mainly written for customized usage on my friends' Discord server, the bot does feature some utilities that you may find useful, despite most of them being relatively unfinished.

## A Thanks
to Ethan Witherington for allowing me to use his **markov** code. You can find his account at https://github.com/Navigatron/
